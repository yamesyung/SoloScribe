Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852i/49628.jpg", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Novels", "Historical Fiction", "Fantasy", "Dystopia", "Literature", "Fiction", "Historical", "Contemporary"], "asin": "B00A2M3QD4", "isbn": "0375507256", "isbn13": "9780375507250", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["David Mitchell"], "publishDate": 1092726000000, "characters": ["Zachry", "Joe Napier", "Yoona-939", "Isaac Sachs", "Hae-Joo Im", "Fay Li", "Bill Smoke", "Timothy Cavendish", "Nurse Noakes", "Ernie Blacksmith", "Rufus Sixsmith", "Old Georgie", "Robert Frobisher", "Sonmi~451", "Mr. Meeks", "Luisa Rey", "Javier Gomez", "Vyvyan Ayrs", "Adam Ewing", "Meronym", "Dr. Goose", "Autua", "Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck", "Jocasta Ayrs"], "places": ["London, England", "Belgium", "South Korea", "England", "Buenas Yerbas", "The United States of America", "Maui, Hawaii", "Chatham Islands", "Seoul, South Korea", "Neerbeke, West Vlaanderen"], "ratingHistogram": [7795, 15507, 41884, 84559, 98375], "ratingsCount": 248120, "reviewsCount": 21895, "numPages": 509, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Best SF Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Arthur C.

They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells\u2019s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing \u201csmarter\u201d human beings or bringing back extinct species.

A cold, snowy morning.Andrei Danilovich Komiaga is fast asleep. A scream, a moan, and a death rattle slowly pull him out of his drunken stupor\u2014but wait, that\u2019s just his ring tone. And so begins another day in the life of an oprichnik, one of the czar\u2019s most trusted courtiers\u2014and one of the country\u2019s most feared men.Welcome to the new New Russia, where futuristic technology and the draconian codes of Ivan the Terrible are in perfect synergy. Corporal punishment is back, as is a divine monarch, but these days everyone gets information from high-tech news bubbles, and the elite get high on hallucinogenic, genetically modified fish.Over the course of one day, Andrei Komiaga will bear witness to\u2014and participate in\u2014brutal executions; extravagant parties; meetings with ballerinas, soothsayers, and even the czarina. He will rape and pillage, and he will be moved to tears by the sweetly sung songs of his homeland. He will consume an arsenal of drugs and denounce threats to his great nation\u2019s morals. And he will fall in love\u2014perhaps even with a number of his colleagues.Vladimir Sorokin, the man described by Keith Gessen (in The New York Review of Books ) as \u201c[the] only real prose writer, and resident genius\u201d of late-Soviet fiction, has imagined a near future both too disturbing to contemplate and too realistic to dismiss. But like all of his best work, Sorokin\u2019s new novel explodes with invention and dark humor.

He is regarded as a leading pioneer of existentialism and one of the greatest philosophers of the 19th Century.In Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309286516i/24965.jpg", "genres": ["Psychology", "Christian", "19th Century", "Theology", "Christianity", "Religion", "Classics", "Danish", "Philosophy", "Nonfiction"], "asin": "0143037579", "isbn": "0143037579", "isbn13": "9780143037576", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard", "Alastair Hannay"], "publishDate": 1148972400000, "ratingHistogram": [534, 1279, 5288, 9535, 9462], "ratingsCount": 26098, "reviewsCount": 1814, "numPages": 152, "language": "English"}

The story of the improbable yet convincingly described travels of the petit-bourgeois (and largely autobiographical) antihero, Bardamu, from the trenches of World War I, to the African jungle, to New York and Detroit, and finally to life as a failed doctor in Paris, takes the readers by the scruff and hurtles them toward the novel's inevitable, sad conclusion.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585118052i/12395.jpg", "genres": ["Philosophy", "France", "French Literature", "Novels", "Roman", "Literature", "Classics", "Fiction", "War", "20th Century"], "asin": "0811216543", "isbn": "0811216543", "isbn13": "9780811216548", "publisher": "New Directions", "series": ["Ferdinand Bardamu"], "author": ["Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line", "Ralph Manheim", "William T.

The mind is designed to often delude us, he argued, about ourselves and about the world. And it is designed to make happiness hard to sustain. But if we know our minds are rigged for anxiety, depression, anger, and greed, what do we do? Wright locates the answer in Buddhism, which figured out thousands of years ago what scientists are only discovering now. Buddhism holds that human suffering is a result of not seeing the world clearly\u2014and proposes that seeing the world more clearly, through meditation, will make us better, happier people. In Why Buddhism is True, Wright leads readers on a journey through psychology, philosophy, and a great many silent retreats to show how and why meditation can serve as the foundation for a spiritual life in a secular age. At once excitingly ambitious and wittily accessible, this is the first book to combine evolutionary psychology with cutting-edge neuroscience to defend the radical claims at the heart of Buddhist philosophy. With bracing honesty and fierce wisdom, it will persuade you not just that Buddhism is true\u2014which is to say, a way out of our delusion\u2014but that it can ultimately save us from ourselves, as individuals and as a species.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500809335i/32895535.jpg", "genres": ["Psychology", "Personal Development", "Spirituality", "Self Help", "Religion", "Buddhism", "Audiobook", "Philosophy", "Science", "Nonfiction"], "asin": "1508235406", "isbn": "1508235406", "isbn13": "9781508235408", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster Audio", "author": ["Robert Wright", "Fred Sanders"], "publishDate": 1502175600000, "ratingHistogram": [347, 1102, 4527, 8930, 8090], "ratingsCount": 22996, "reviewsCount": 2151, "numPages": 11, "language": "English"}

Lord have pity on us!\" With these words, Pierre Boulle hurtles teh reader onto the Planet of the Apes. In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research. On the planet of the apes, man, having reached to apotheosis of his genius, has become inert. To this planet come a journalist and a scientist. The scientist is put into a zoo, the journalist into a laboratory. Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man. Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller. With his cutomary wit, irony, and disciplined intellect and style, the author of The Bridge Over the River Kwai tells a swiftly moving story dealing with man's conflicts, and takes the reader into a suspenseful and strangely fascinating orbit.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333359714i/847448.jpg", "genres": ["France", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Novels", "Fantasy", "Dystopia", "Media Tie In", "Adventure", "Classics", "Fiction"], "publisher": "Penguin", "series": ["Planet of the Apes"], "author": ["Pierre Boulle", "Xan Fielding"], "publishDate": 23007600000, "characters": ["Phyllis (Planet of the Apes)", "Zira", "Nova (Planet of the Apes)", "Zaius", "Jinn (Planet of the Apes)", "Arthur Levain", "Cornelius (Planet of the Apes)", "Professor Antelle", "Ulysse M\u00e9rou"], "ratingHistogram": [661, 1935, 9241, 15804, 14198], "ratingsCount": 41839, "reviewsCount": 2428, "numPages": 174, "language": "English"}

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \"lickings\" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn \u00ad the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \"tattle-tale.\"  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \"engaged\" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:\"TOM!\" No answer. \"TOM!\" No answer. \"What's gone with that boy, \u00a0I wonder?

He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays.

Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent. Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague, Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host's daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain's thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story, Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man's self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade's story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade's life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. \"Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant, written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter.It is enough to make stones weep.\" \u2014 Literary ReviewMircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works, as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal, are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950, Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success.

But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.

Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant \"shining\" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes \"Doctor Sleep.\"Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival.

Florence is a talented musician who dreams of a career on the concert stage and of the perfect life she will create with Edward, an earnest young history student at University College of London, who unexpectedly wooed and won her heart. Newly married that morning, both virgins, Edward and Florence arrive at a hotel on the Dorset coast. At dinner in their rooms they struggle to suppress their worries about the wedding night to come. Edward, eager for rapture, frets over Florence\u2019s response to his advances and nurses a private fear of failure, while Florence\u2019s anxieties run deeper: she is overcome by sheer disgust at the idea of physical contact, but dreads disappointing her husband when they finally lie down together in the honeymoon suite. Ian McEwan has caught with understanding and compassion the innocence of Edward and Florence at a time when marriage was presumed to be the outward sign of maturity and independence.

But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between Life and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the \"R\" stood for robot--and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335782224i/41811.jpg", "genres": ["Crime", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Novels", "Robots", "Audiobook", "Classics", "Mystery", "Detective"], "publisher": "Voyager", "series": ["Robot, chronological order", "Greater Foundation Universe", "Robot"], "author": ["Isaac Asimov"], "publishDate": 852105600000, "characters": ["Elijah Baley", "R.

The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert's acquittal on 7 February 1857, Madame Bovary became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes.

Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:\u00b7 Prologue: The Illustrated Man \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Veldt [\u201cThe World the Children Made\u201d] \u00b7 ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 \u201950 \u00b7 Kaleidoscope \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct \u201949 \u00b7 The Other Foot \u00b7 ss New Story Magazine Mar \u201951 \u00b7 The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] \u00b7 ss Copy Spr \u201950 \u00b7 The Man \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb \u201949 \u00b7 The Long Rain [\u201cDeath-by-Rain\u201d] \u00b7 ss Planet Stories Sum \u201950 \u00b7 The Rocket Man \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Mar 1 \u201951 \u00b7 The Fire Balloons [\u201c\u2018In This Sign...\u2019\u201d] \u00b7 ss Imagination Apr \u201951 \u00b7 The Last Night of the World \u00b7 ss Esquire Feb \u201951 \u00b7 The Exiles [\u201cThe Mad Wizards of Mars\u201d] \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Sep 15 \u201949; F&amp;SF Win \u201950 \u00b7 No Particular Night or Morning \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Fox and the Forest [\u201cTo the Future\u201d] \u00b7 ss Colliers May 13 \u201950 \u00b7 The Visitor \u00b7 ss Startling Stories Nov \u201948 \u00b7 The Concrete Mixer \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr \u201949 \u00b7 Marionettes, Inc.
