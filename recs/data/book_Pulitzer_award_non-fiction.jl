Blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in American history\u2014an \u201cAge of Neoslavery\u201d that thrived from the aftermath of the Civil War through the dawn of World War II.Under laws enacted specifically to intimidate blacks, tens of thousands of African Americans were arbitrarily arrested, hit with outrageous fines, and charged for the costs of their own arrests. With no means to pay these ostensible \u201cdebts,\u201d prisoners were sold as forced laborers to coal mines, lumber camps, brickyards, railroads, quarries, and farm plantations. Thousands of other African Americans were simply seized by southern landowners and compelled into years of involuntary servitude. Government officials leased falsely imprisoned blacks to small-town entrepreneurs, provincial farmers, and dozens of corporations\u2014including U.S. Steel\u2014looking for cheap and abundant labor. Armies of \u201cfree\u201d black men labored without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced through beatings and physical torture to do the bidding of white masters for decades after the official abolition of American slavery.The neoslavery system exploited legal loopholes and federal policies that discouraged prosecution of whites for continuing to hold black workers against their wills. As it poured millions of dollars into southern government treasuries, the new slavery also became a key instrument in the terrorization of African Americans seeking full participation in the U.S. political system.Based on a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Slavery by Another Name unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude. It also reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the modern companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the system\u2019s final demise in the 1940s, partly due to fears of enemy propaganda about American racial abuse at the beginning of World War II.Slavery by Another Name is a moving, sobering account of a little-known crime against African Americans, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320504147i/2319745.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Social Justice", "Sociology", "History", "Anti Racist", "African American", "Race", "Historical"], "asin": "0385506252", "isbn": "0385506252", "isbn13": "9780385506250", "publisher": "Doubleday Books", "author": ["Douglas A.

Tracy Kidder got a preview of this world in the late 1970s when he observed the engineers of Data General design and build a new 32-bit minicomputer in just one year. His thoughtful, prescient book, The Soul of a New Machine, tells stories of 35-year-old \"veteran\" engineers hiring recent college graduates and encouraging them to work harder and faster on complex and difficult projects, exploiting the youngsters' ignorance of normal scheduling processes while engendering a new kind of work ethic.These days, we are used to the \"total commitment\" philosophy of managing technical creation, but Kidder was surprised and even a little alarmed at the obsessions and compulsions he found. From in-house political struggles to workers being permitted to tease management to marathon 24-hour work sessions, The Soul of a New Machine explores concepts that already seem familiar, even old-hat, less than 20 years later. Kidder plainly admires his subjects; while he admits to hopeless confusion about their work, he finds their dedication heroic.

In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history, the moment when the United States began to act like a great power.Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and Rommel.Brilliantly researched, rich with new material and vivid insights, Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440057096i/541920.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Africa", "Nonfiction", "Military Fiction", "Military History", "History", "War", "World War II", "World History", "Historical"], "asin": "0805062882", "isbn": "0805062882", "isbn13": "9780805062885", "publisher": "Henry Holt and Co.", "series": ["World War II Liberation Trilogy"], "author": ["Rick Atkinson"], "publishDate": 1033542000000, "places": ["North Africa", "Tunisia"], "ratingHistogram": [211, 517, 2553, 7361, 10144], "ratingsCount": 20786, "reviewsCount": 1252, "numPages": 681, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "History", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Society for History in the Federal Government Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "The Society for Military History Distinguished Book Award", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

It is a book which throws light on many features of the American character. Its concern is not merely to portray the scorners of intellect in American life, but to say something about what the intellectual is, and can be, as a force in a democratic society.Hofstadter set out to trace the social movements that altered the role of intellect in American society from a virtue to a vice. In so doing, he explored questions regarding the purpose of education and whether the democratization of education altered that purpose and reshaped its form.In considering the historic tension between access to education and excellence in education, Hofstadter argued that both anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were consequences, in part, of the democratization of knowledge.Moreover, he saw these themes as historically embedded in America's national fabric, an outcome of her colonial European and evangelical Protestant heritage. Anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were functions of American cultural heritage, not necessarily of democracy.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327787785i/582067.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "American", "Philosophy", "Education", "Sociology", "History", "Political Science", "Cultural"], "asin": "0394703170", "isbn": "0394703170", "isbn13": "9780394703176", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["Richard Hofstadter"], "publishDate": -189360000000, "ratingHistogram": [44, 108, 551, 1196, 1298], "ratingsCount": 3197, "reviewsCount": 356, "numPages": 434, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -189360000000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award Finalist", "awardedAt": -189360000000, "category": "History and Biography", "hasWon": null}]}

Can our minds keep up with the pace of change? How can we find balance? Through Richtel's beautifully constructed narrative, a complex and far-reaching topic becomes intimate and urgent--an important call to reexamine our own lives. On the last day of summer, an ordinary Utah college student named Reggie Shaw fatally struck two rocket scientists while texting and driving along a majestic stretch of highway bordering the Rocky Mountains. Richtel follows Reggie from the moment of the tragedy, through the police investigation, the state's groundbreaking prosecution (at the time there was little precedent to guide the court), and ultimately, Reggie's wrenching admission of responsibility. Richtel parallels Reggie's journey with leading-edge scientific findings regarding human attention and the impact of technology on our brains--showing how these devices, now thoroughly embedded in all aspects of our lives, play to our deepest social instincts and prey on parts of the brain that crave stimulation, creating loops of compulsion, even addiction.

Born at the turn of a new century, Dasani is named for the bottled water that comes to symbolize Brooklyn\u2019s gentrification and the shared aspirations of a divided city. As Dasani grows up, moving with her tight-knit family from shelter to shelter, this story goes back to trace the passage of Dasani\u2019s ancestors from slavery to the Great Migration north. By the time Dasani comes of age, New York City\u2019s homeless crisis is exploding as the chasm deepens between rich and poor. In the shadows of this new Gilded Age, Dasani must lead her seven siblings through a thicket of problems: hunger, parental drug addiction, violence, housing instability, segregated schools, and the constant monitoring of the child-protection system. When, at age thirteen, Dasani enrolls at a boarding school in Pennsylvania, her loyalties are tested like never before. As she learns to \u201ccode switch\u201d between the culture she left behind and the norms of her new town, Dasani starts to feel like a stranger in both places. Ultimately, she faces an impossible question: What if leaving poverty means abandoning the family you love? By turns heartbreaking and revelatory, provocative and inspiring, Invisible Child tells an astonishing story about the power of resilience, the importance of family, and the cost of inequality. Based on nearly a decade of reporting, this book vividly illuminates some of the most critical issues in contemporary America through the life of one remarkable girl.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1629820319i/57359691.jpg", "genres": ["Poverty", "Politics", "Social Justice", "Nonfiction", "Sociology", "History", "Memoir", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Race"], "asin": "0812986946", "isbn": "0812986946", "isbn13": "9780812986945", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["Andrea Elliott"], "publishDate": 1633417200000, "ratingHistogram": [42, 75, 533, 2884, 11834], "ratingsCount": 15368, "reviewsCount": 1955, "numPages": 602, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "Shortlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Helen Bernstein Book Award", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "Excellence in Journalism", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": "Current Interest", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Dayton Literary Peace Prize", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "The Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}]}

It was a bustling port city with a burgeoning African American middle class and a Fusionist government of Republicans and Populists that included black aldermen, police officers and magistrates. There were successful black-owned businesses and an African American newspaper, The Record. But across the state--and the South--white supremacist Democrats were working to reverse the advances made by former slaves and their progeny.In 1898, in response to a speech calling for white men to rise to the defense of Southern womanhood against the supposed threat of black predators, Alexander Manly, the outspoken young Record editor, wrote that some relationships between black men and white women were consensual. His editorial ignited outrage across the South, with calls to lynch Manly.But North Carolina's white supremacist Democrats had a different strategy. They were plotting to take back the state legislature in November \"by the ballot or bullet or both,\" and then use the Manly editorial to trigger a \"race riot\" to overthrow Wilmington's multi-racial government. Led by prominent citizens including Josephus Daniels, publisher of the state's largest newspaper, and former Confederate Colonel Alfred Moore Waddell, white supremacists rolled out a carefully orchestrated campaign that included raucous rallies, race-baiting editorials and newspaper cartoons, and sensational, fabricated news stories.With intimidation and violence, the Democrats suppressed the black vote and stuffed ballot boxes (or threw them out), to win control of the state legislature on November eighth. Two days later, more than 2,000 heavily armed Red Shirts swarmed through Wilmington, torching the Record office, terrorizing women and children, and shooting at least sixty black men dead in the streets. The rioters forced city officials to resign at gunpoint and replaced them with mob leaders. Prominent blacks--and sympathetic whites--were banished. Hundreds of terrified black families took refuge in surrounding swamps and forests.This brutal insurrection is a rare instance of a violent overthrow of an elected government in the U.S. It halted gains made by blacks and restored racism as official government policy, cementing white rule for another half century. It was not a \"race riot,\" as the events of November 1898 came to be known, but rather a racially motivated rebellion launched by white supremacists.In Wilmington's Lie, Zucchino uses contemporary newspaper accounts, diaries, letters and official communications to create a gripping and compelling narrative that weaves together individual stories of hate and fear and brutality. This is a dramatic and definitive account of a remarkable but forgotten chapter of American history.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571117991l/51243325.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Crime", "History", "True Crime", "Audiobook", "African American", "Race", "Historical"], "asin": "0802128386", "isbn": "0802128386", "isbn13": "9780802128386", "publisher": "Atlantic Monthly Press", "author": ["David Zucchino"], "publishDate": 1578384000000, "places": ["Wilmington, North Carolina"], "ratingHistogram": [16, 45, 289, 1249, 1982], "ratingsCount": 3581, "reviewsCount": 675, "numPages": 426, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}]}

Symbolizing a future of endless promise, it was the foundation of the United States' belief in itself as an exceptional nation--democratic, individualistic, forward-looking. Today, though, America has a new symbol: the border wall.In The End of the Myth, acclaimed historian Greg Grandin explores the meaning of the frontier throughout the full sweep of U.S. history--from the American Revolution to the War of 1898, the New Deal to the election of 2016. For centuries, he shows, America's constant expansion--fighting wars and opening markets--served as a \"gate of escape,\" helping to deflect domestic political and economic conflicts outward. But this deflection meant that the country's problems, from racism to inequality, were never confronted directly. And now, the combined catastrophe of the 2008 financial meltdown and our unwinnable wars in the Middle East have slammed this gate shut, bringing political passions that had long been directed elsewhere back home.It is this new reality, Grandin says, that explains the rise of reactionary populism and racist nationalism, the extreme anger and polarization that catapulted Trump to the presidency. The border wall may or may not be built, but it will survive as a rallying point, an allegorical tombstone marking the end of American exceptionalism.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550130112i/36743029.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "The United States Of America", "Nonfiction", "Social Justice", "American", "Sociology", "History", "Audiobook", "Race"], "asin": "1250179823", "isbn": "1250179823", "isbn13": "9781250179821", "publisher": "Metropolitan Books", "author": ["Greg Grandin"], "publishDate": 1551772800000, "ratingHistogram": [16, 58, 345, 914, 1282], "ratingsCount": 2615, "reviewsCount": 399, "numPages": 369, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}]}

Critics have assailed the rise of mass incarceration, emphasizing its disproportionate impact on people of color. As James Forman, Jr., points out, however, the war on crime that began in the 1970s was supported by many African American leaders in the nation\u2019s urban centers. In Locking Up Our Own, he seeks to understand why.Forman shows us that the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges, and police chiefs took office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction. Many prominent black officials, including Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry and federal prosecutor Eric Holder, feared that the gains of the civil rights movement were being undermined by lawlessness\u2014and thus embraced tough-on-crime measures, including longer sentences and aggressive police tactics. In the face of skyrocketing murder rates and the proliferation of open-air drug markets, they believed they had no choice. But the policies they adopted would have devastating consequences for residents of poor black neighborhoods.A former D.C. public defender, Forman tells riveting stories of politicians, community activists, police officers, defendants, and crime victims. He writes with compassion about individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas\u2014from the men and women he represented in court to officials struggling to respond to a public safety emergency.

Their problematic achievement was based on cunning business strategies and marketing dazzle, deft political power plays, and a relentless, often devious attack on antismoking forces in science, public health, and government. Enabling the whole process to unfold was the weirdly symbiotic relationship of an industry geared at any cost to sell, sell, sell cigarettes, and an American public habituated to ignore all health warnings and buy, buy, buy.At the center of this epic is the continuing drama of the Philip Morris Company and the crafty men at its helm.

Remarkably, the company\u2019s global prosperity mounted steadily even as the news about cigarettes and health grew more dire by the year.Caught up in the Philip Morris story is the whole sweep of America\u2019s cigarette history, from the glory days of rampant hucksterism \u2013 when smokers would \u201cwalk a mile for a Camel,\u201d Winston tasted \u201cgood like a cigarette should,\u201d and most of the nation could decipher \u201cL.S. / M.F.T\u201d \u2013 to the bombshell 1964 Surgeon General\u2019s Report that definitively indicted smoking as a killer, to the age of the massive mergers that spawned RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris-Kraft General Foods.Here we learn how the leaf that was the New World\u2019s most passionately devoured gift to the Old grew into humankind\u2019s most dangerous consumer product, employing a vast rural corps of laborers, fattening tax revenues, and propagating a ring of fiercely competitive corporate superpowers; how tobacco\u2019s peerless public-relations spinners applied their techniques to becloud the overwhelming evidence of the cigarette\u2019s lethal and addictive nature; and finally, how the besieged industry and the aroused public-health forces nationwide collided over whether to outlaw the butt habit altogether or bring it into ever more withering social disdain and under ever tighter government control.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388206012i/335451.jpg", "genres": ["Social Science", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Economics", "History", "Business", "Health", "Science", "Medical", "Psychology"], "asin": "0375700366", "isbn": "0375700366", "isbn13": "9780375700361", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["Richard Kluger"], "publishDate": 870159600000, "ratingHistogram": [8, 17, 57, 104, 88], "ratingsCount": 274, "reviewsCount": 35, "numPages": 832, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 852105600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 820483200000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

This is an incredible true account of investigative journalism and a devastating indictment of energy politics in America.Stacey Haney, a lifelong resident of Amity, Pennsylvania, is struggling to support her children when the fracking boom comes to town. Like most of her neighbors, she sees the energy companies' payments as a windfall. Soon trucks are rumbling down her unpaved road and a fenced-off fracking site rises on adjacent land. But her annoyance gives way to concern and then to fear as domestic animals and pets begin dying and mysterious illnesses strike her family--despite the companies' insistence that nothing is wrong.Griswold masterfully chronicles Haney's transformation into an unlikely whistle-blower as she launches her own investigation into corporate wrongdoing. As she takes her case to court, Haney inadvertently reveals the complex rifts in her community and begins to reshape its attitudes toward outsiders, corporations, and the federal government. Amity and Prosperity uses her gripping and moving tale to show the true costs of our energy infrastructure and to illuminate the predicament of rural America in the twenty-first century.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518912372i/36722972.jpg", "genres": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Journalism", "Social Justice", "Sociology", "History", "Environment", "Science", "Nature", "Audiobook"], "asin": "0374103119", "isbn": "0374103119", "isbn13": "9780374103118", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "author": ["Eliza Griswold"], "publishDate": 1528786800000, "ratingHistogram": [8, 80, 504, 1840, 1763], "ratingsCount": 4195, "reviewsCount": 563, "numPages": 318, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Shortlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Helen Bernstein Book Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Excellence in Journalism", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Science & Technology", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Ridenhour Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

While slavery has always caused considerable social and psychological tension, Western culture has associated it with certain religious and philosophical doctrines that gave it the highest sanction. The contradiction of slavery grew more profound when it became closely linked with American colonization, which had as its basic foundation the desire and opportunity to create a more perfect society. Davis provides a comparative analysis of slave systems in the Old World, a discussion of the early attitudes towards American slavery, and a detailed exploration of the early protests against Negro bondage, as well as the religious, literary, and philosophical developments that contributed to both sides in the controversies of the late eighteenth century. This exemplaryintroduction to the history of slavery in Western culture presents the traditions in thought and value that gave rise to the attitudes of both abolitionists and defenders of slavery in the late eighteenth century as well as the nineteenth century.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348527623i/178709.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Social Science", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Economics", "Sociology", "History", "European History", "Race", "World History"], "asin": "0195056396", "isbn": "0195056396", "isbn13": "9780195056396", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "series": ["The Problem of Slavery"], "author": ["David Brion Davis"], "publishDate": 593334000000, "ratingHistogram": [5, 3, 29, 68, 55], "ratingsCount": 160, "reviewsCount": 15, "numPages": 528, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -94665600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award Finalist", "awardedAt": -94665600000, "category": "History and Biography", "hasWon": null}]}

In the last half of the twentieth century the two superpowers had perfected the science of mass destruction and possessed nuclear weapons with the combined power of a million Hiroshimas. What\u2019s more, a Soviet biological warfare machine was ready to produce bacteria and viruses to sicken and kill millions. In The Dead Hand, a thrilling narrative history drawing on new archives and original research and interviews, David E. Hoffman reveals how presidents, scientists, diplomats, soldiers, and spies confronted the danger and changed the course of history. The Dead Hand captures the inside story in both the United States and the Soviet Union, giving us an urgent and intimate account of the last decade of the arms race. With access to secret Kremlin documents, Hoffman chronicles Soviet internal deliberations that have long been hidden. He reveals that weapons designers in 1985 laid a massive \u201cStar Wars\u201d program on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to compete with President Reagan, but Gorbachev refused to build it. He unmasks the cover-up of the Soviet biological weapons program. He tells the exclusive story of one Soviet microbiologist\u2019s quest to build a genetically engineered super-germ\u2014it would cause a mild illness, a deceptive recovery, then a second, fatal attack. And he details the frightening history of the Doomsday Machine, known as the Dead Hand, which would launch a retaliatory nuclear strike if the Soviet leaders were wiped out. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the dangers remained. Soon rickety trains were hauling unsecured nuclear warheads across the Russian steppe; tons of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium lay unguarded in warehouses; and microbiologists and bomb designers were scavenging for food to feed their families. The Dead Hand offers fresh and startling insights into Reagan and Gorbachev, the two key figures of the end of the Cold War, and draws colorful, unforgettable portraits of many others who struggled, often valiantly, to save the world from the most terrifying weapons known to man.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320419175i/6623920.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Russia", "Military Fiction", "History", "Military History", "Science", "War", "World History"], "asin": "0385524374", "isbn": "0385524374", "isbn13": "9780385524377", "publisher": "Doubleday", "author": ["David E.

After being tried and convicted, he immediately insisted on being executed for his crime. To do so, he fought a system that seemed intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. And that fight for the right to die is what made him famous.Mailer tells not only Gilmore's story, but those of the men and women caught in the web of his life and drawn into his procession toward the firing squad. All with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscape and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah.

To most Americans, Russia remains as enigmatic today as it was during the Iron Curtain era. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country had an opportunity to face its tortured past. In Inside the Stalin Archives , Jonathan Brent asks, why didn't this happen? Why are the anti-Semitic Protocols of Zion sold openly in the lobby of the State Duma? Why are archivists under surveillance and phones still tapped? Why does Stalin, a man responsible for the deaths of millions of his own people, remain popular enough to appear on boxes of chocolate sold in Moscow's airport?Brent draws on fifteen years of unprecedented access to high-level Soviet Archives to answer these questions. He shows us a Russia where, in 1992, used toothbrushes were sold on the sidewalks, while now shops are filled with luxury goods and the streets are jammed with Mercedes. Stalin's specter hovers throughout, and in the book's crescendo Brent takes us deep into the dictator's personal papers to glimpse the dark heart of the new Russia.

Eight years later, a schoolteacher who lived four miles away gave birth to a boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast growing tumors that soon riddled his face and chest. The doctors predicted he would not reach his first birthday. They were wrong, but that was only one of many surprises that would eventually come to light in Toms River, culminating in 2001 with a record legal settlement believed to top $35 million and an unprecedented government study confirming the existence of a long-suspected cluster of childhood cancer linked to polluted water and air.

The book describes and interprets the persecution and murder of the Jews throughout occupied Europe. The enactment of German extermination policies and measures depended on the cooperation of local authorities, the assistance of police forces, and the passivity of the populations, primarily of their political and spiritual elites. This implementation depended as well on the victims\u2019 readiness to submit to orders, often with the hope of attenuating them or of surviving long enough to escape the German vise.This multifaceted study\u2014at all levels and in different places\u2014enhances the perception of the magnitude, complexity, and interrelatedness of the many components of this history.

Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407707626i/93959.jpg", "genres": ["Asia", "Politics", "Japan", "Nonfiction", "History", "Biography", "Japanese Literature", "War", "World War II", "World History"], "asin": "0060931302", "isbn": "0060931302", "isbn13": "9780060931308", "publisher": "Harper Perennial", "author": ["Herbert P.

Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court when he became embroiled in an explosive and deadly case that threatened to change the course of the civil rights movement and cost him his life.In 1949, Florida\u2019s orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve. When a white seventeen-year-old Groveland girl cried rape, McCall was fast on the trail of four young blacks who dared to envision a future for themselves beyond the citrus groves. By day\u2019s end, the Ku Klux Klan had rolled into town, burning the homes of blacks to the ground and chasing hundreds into the swamps, hell-bent on lynching the young men who came to be known as \u201cthe Groveland Boys.\u201dAnd so began the chain of events that would bring Thurgood Marshall, the man known as \u201cMr. Civil Rights,\u201d into the deadly fray.

The Gulag entered the world's historical consciousness in 1972, with the publication of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's epic oral history of the Soviet camps, The Gulag Archipelago. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, dozens of memoirs and new studies covering aspects of that system have been published in Russia and the West. Using these new resources as well as her own original historical research, Anne Applebaum has now undertaken, for the first time, a fully documented history of the Soviet camp system, from its origins in the Russian Revolution to its collapse in the era of glasnost. It is an epic feat of investigation and moral reckoning that places the Gulag where it belongs: at the center of our understanding of the troubled history of the twentieth century. Anne Applebaum first lays out the chronological history of the camps and the logic behind their creation, enlargement, and maintenance. The Gulag was first put in place in 1918 after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, Stalin personally decided to expand the camp system, both to use forced labor to accelerate Soviet industrialization and to exploit the natural resources of the country's barely habitable far northern regions. By the end of the 1930s, labor camps could be found in all twelve of the Soviet Union's time zones. The system continued to expand throughout the war years, reaching its height only in the early 1950s. From 1929 until the death of Stalin in 1953, some 18 million people passed through this massive system. Of these 18 million, it is estimated that 4.5 million never returned. But the Gulag was not just an economic institution. It also became, over time, a country within a country, almost a separate civilization, with its own laws, customs, literature, folklore, slang, and morality. Topic by topic, Anne Applebaum also examines how life was lived within this shadow country: how prisoners worked, how they ate, where they lived, how they died, how they survived. She examines their guards and their jailers, the horrors of transportation in empty cattle cars, the strange nature of Soviet arrests and trials, the impact of World War II, the relations between different national and religious groups, and the escapes, as well as the extraordinary rebellions that took place in the 1950s. She concludes by examining the disturbing question why the Gulag has remained relatively obscure, in the historical memory of both the former Soviet Union and the West. Gulag: A History will immediately be recognized as a landmark work of historical scholarship and an indelible contribution to the complex, ongoing, necessary quest for truth.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410286909i/224379.jpg", "genres": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Soviet Union", "Russia", "History", "Russian History", "European History", "War", "World History", "Historical"], "asin": "0767900561", "isbn": "0767900561", "isbn13": "9780767900560", "publisher": "Doubleday", "author": ["Anne Applebaum"], "publishDate": 1051599600000, "ratingHistogram": [106, 270, 1466, 4348, 5539], "ratingsCount": 11729, "reviewsCount": 985, "numPages": 677, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Mark Lynton History Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Duff Cooper Prize", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award Finalist", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

He portrays Washington as a strapping, celebrated horseman, elegant dancer and tireless hunter, who guarded his emotional life with intriguing ferocity. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, he orchestrated their actions to help realise his vision for the new federal government, define the separation of powers, and establish the office of the presidency.Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding.

An extraordinary history of an empire undone, Lenin\u2019s Tomb stands as essential reading for our times.\u00a0\u00a0", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442415682i/113206.jpg", "genres": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Journalism", "Soviet Union", "Russia", "History", "Russian History", "European History", "World History", "Historical"], "asin": "0679751254", "isbn": "0679751254", "isbn13": "9780679751250", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["David Remnick"], "publishDate": 767343600000, "ratingHistogram": [51, 152, 642, 1703, 2355], "ratingsCount": 4903, "reviewsCount": 411, "numPages": 588, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Helen Bernstein Book Award", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Excellence in Journalism", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 725875200000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist\u2019s precision, a historian\u2019s perspective, and a biographer\u2019s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out \u201cwar against cancer.\u201d The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee\u2019s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive\u2014and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1280771091i/7170627.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Health", "Popular Science", "Science", "Medical", "Biography", "Biology", "Audiobook", "Medicine"], "publisher": "Scribner", "author": ["Siddhartha Mukherjee"], "publishDate": 1289894400000, "ratingHistogram": [1385, 2481, 11201, 33184, 54586], "ratingsCount": 102837, "reviewsCount": 8384, "numPages": 571, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Guardian First Book Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "J.

Lawrence Wright's remarkable book is based on five years of research and hundreds of interviews that he conducted in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, England, France, Germany, Spain, and the United States.The Looming Tower achieves an unprecedented level of intimacy and insight by telling the story through the interweaving lives of four men: the two leaders of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri; the FBI's counterterrorism chief, John O'Neill; and the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Faisal.As these lives unfold, we see revealed: the crosscurrents of modern Islam that helped to radicalize Zawahiri and bin Laden . . . the birth of al-Qaeda and its unsteady development into an organization capable of the American embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the attack on the USS Cole . . . O'Neill's heroic efforts to track al-Qaeda before 9/11, and his tragic death in the World Trade towers . . . Prince Turki's transformation from bin Laden's ally to his enemy . . . the failures of the FBI, CIA, and NSA to share intelligence that might have prevented the 9/11 attacks.The Looming Tower broadens and deepens our knowledge of these signal events by taking us behind the scenes. Here is Sayyid Qutb, founder of the modern Islamist movement, lonely and despairing as he meets Western culture up close in 1940s America; the privileged childhoods of bin Laden and Zawahiri; family life in the al-Qaeda compounds of Sudan and Afghanistan; O'Neill's high-wire act in balancing his all-consuming career with his equally entangling personal life--he was living with three women, each of them unaware of the others' existence--and the nitty-gritty of turf battles among U.S. intelligence agencies.Brilliantly conceived and written, The Looming Tower draws all elements of the story into a galvanizing narrative that adds immeasurably to our understanding of how we arrived at September 11, 2001. The richness of its new information, and the depth of its perceptions, can help us deal more wisely and effectively with the continuing terrorist threat.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320471617i/110890.jpg", "genres": ["American History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Islam", "Military Fiction", "History", "Religion", "Terrorism", "War", "Audiobook"], "asin": "037541486X", "isbn": "037541486X", "isbn13": "9780375414862", "publisher": "Knopf", "author": ["Lawrence Wright"], "publishDate": 1155020400000, "ratingHistogram": [315, 597, 3143, 11788, 16874], "ratingsCount": 32717, "reviewsCount": 2870, "numPages": 469, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "J.

From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.

In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes.
