Even the fact that Miles is third in line to the throne and personally owns a major chunk of his home planet would not tempt any normal person to change places with him.When assassins came to rid the world of his father, his mother, pregnant with Miles, was in the line of fire, and Miles was but an egg for the omelet in an all too literal sense. Thanks to heroic medical intervention, Miles survived his near fatal brush with war gas-as a pain-filled dwarf with bones as weak and brittle as some malign composite of chalk and glass. Miles is often mistaken for a mutant by his mutant loathing countrymen.But there is one who does envy him, who wants to be him: his brother, his cloned stranger formed from tissue stolen from Miles when he was a child. For Mark Vorkosigan was created and raised up for only one purpose: to become Miles, to murder and replace him. In Brothers in Arms that conspiracy was routed and Mark made more or less compliant to his new Miles-less fate. But in the intervening years Mark has learned that without Miles he is . . . nothing. The new and better Mark doesn't really want to kill his brother, but still it may come to that: Mark to stay, Miles to go. . . .", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694202946i/61909.jpg", "genres": ["Science Fiction Fantasy", "Adventure", "Hugo Awards", "Fiction", "Space", "Fantasy", "Military Fiction", "Space Opera", "Audiobook", "Science Fiction"], "asin": "B0073AQ1O4", "isbn": "0671876465", "isbn13": "9780671876463", "publisher": "Baen Books", "series": ["Vorkosigan Saga (Publication Order)", "Vorkosigan Saga (Chronological)"], "author": ["Lois McMaster Bujold"], "publishDate": 794044800000, "characters": ["Miles Vorkosigan"], "ratingHistogram": [175, 377, 2577, 8136, 10727], "ratingsCount": 21992, "reviewsCount": 840, "numPages": 560, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "Best Science Fiction Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg", "genres": ["Young Adult", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "War", "Adventure", "Fiction", "Classics", "Dystopia", "Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Science Fiction"], "asin": "0812550706", "isbn": "0812550706", "isbn13": "9780812550702", "publisher": "Tor", "series": ["Enderverse:  Publication Order", "Ender's Saga", "The Enderverse"], "author": ["Orson Scott Card"], "publishDate": 1096527600000, "characters": ["Mazer Rackham", "Petra Arkanian", "Peter Wiggin", "Valentine Wiggin", "Bernard", "\"Bean\"", "Alai", "Major Imbu", "Hyrum Graff", "Dink", "Andrew Wiggin", "Major Anderson", "Bonzo"], "places": ["Outer Space"], "ratingHistogram": [23403, 42076, 158571, 409519, 733850], "ratingsCount": 1367419, "reviewsCount": 49448, "numPages": 324, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 504950400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 473414400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Ignotus", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Mejor Cuento Extranjero", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premi Ictineu", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "Millor novel\u00b7la tradu\u00efda", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Margaret A.

When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom? That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. --Craig E.

One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his backyard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk\u2015a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside\u2015more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans\u2026 and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun\u2015and report back on what they find.

Invariably. She was limited only in that she had to have facts -- not assumptions -- with which to work. Given those facts, her conclusions and predictions were inevitably correct. And that made Bossy a 'ticking bomb.'Bossy had been designed as a servomechanism for guiding airplanes. But she became something much greater: a hypercomputer. Soon the men who worked with Bossy found themselves able to solve their problems, to erase their prejudices - in short, to think.Did the world welcome Bossy with open arms and glad cries? No, because for four decades the world had been in the grip of opinion control, and Bossy represented a serious threat to that dominance. So Bossy had to go underground, and work in hiding. Which was why Joe Carter, the worlds only true telepath, and two brilliant Professors had to assume the role of Skid Row bums. All this is only the beginning of one of the most thoughtfully written, and thought provoking, science fiction novels ever written. It shows convincingly and compellingly, what would happen if everyone in the world were given a single blunt command: Think or die.Only a small handful of people are mature enough to realize that they don\u2019t know all the answers. And it was only to this handful that Bossy offered the greatest gift of all: immortality. But all people wanted immortality, wanted it with a fixed and burning desire. And gradually the tension increased, the mobs grew restless, the military became more demanding\u2014and the 'bomb' ticked swiftly on. And it was up to Joe Carter to stave off catastrophe. THE FOREVER MACHINE is full of excitement, both physical and mental. It is full, too, of rich rewards for the reader who appreciates genuinely mature philosophy tinged with gentle irony. And among other things, it is that rare event: a science fiction novel based on a brand-new idea.Cover art by Wallace Wood.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325043314i/754001.jpg", "genres": ["Science Fiction Fantasy", "Speculative Fiction", "20th Century", "Novels", "Hugo Awards", "Fiction", "Adult", "Classics", "Sci Fi Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "asin": "0898651654", "isbn": "0898651654", "isbn13": "9780898651652", "publisher": "Starblaze / The Donning Company", "author": ["Mark Clifton", "Frank Riley"], "publishDate": 347184000000, "characters": ["Joe Carter"], "ratingHistogram": [128, 284, 394, 290, 155], "ratingsCount": 1251, "reviewsCount": 172, "numPages": 173, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": -473356800000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he\u2019s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son\u2019s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access\u2014through nodes designed into smart clothes\u2014and to see the digital context\u2014through smart contact lenses.  With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.  In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert\u2019s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot.  As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729149i/102439.jpg", "genres": ["Hard Science Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Speculative Fiction", "Cyberpunk", "Novels", "Hugo Awards", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Near Future", "Science Fiction"], "asin": "0812536363", "isbn": "0812536363", "isbn13": "9780812536362", "publisher": "Tor Science Fiction", "author": ["Vernor Vinge"], "publishDate": 1175583600000, "places": ["San Diego, California"], "ratingHistogram": [467, 1482, 4681, 6629, 4858], "ratingsCount": 18117, "reviewsCount": 1045, "numPages": 381, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Best Science Fiction Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "John W.

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life\u2014and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder\u2014right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage\u2014and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.(front flap)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528196883i/16703.jpg", "genres": ["Alternate History", "Mystery", "Literature", "Jewish", "Novels", "Crime", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Literary Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "asin": "0007149824", "isbn": "0007149824", "isbn13": "9780007149827", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "author": ["Michael Chabon"], "publishDate": 1178002800000, "characters": ["Mendel Shpilman", "Ester-Malke Shemets", "Berko Shemets", "Itzik Zimbalist", "Meyer Landsman", "Naomi Landsman", "Alter Litvak", "Bina Gelbfish", "Hertz Shemets"], "places": ["Sitka, Alaska"], "ratingHistogram": [2646, 6187, 19681, 29960, 18029], "ratingsCount": 76503, "reviewsCount": 7687, "numPages": 414, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "Best Science Fiction Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Hammett Prize", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "California Book Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Fiction (Gold)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "John W.
