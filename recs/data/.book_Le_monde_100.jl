Il a donc pris une d\u00e9cision.

Le Cl\u00e9zio, revelation of the literary year\" ran the headline of the Paris Express after last year's prizes had been awarded. The Goncourt jury was locked five to five until its president used his double vote to give the prize to the older candidate. Ten minutes later the Renaudot jury elected the candidate they thought they might lose to the other prize. Most of the literary sections ran their prize news putting the Renaudot first, in order to feature the twenty-three-year-old discovery that was rocking Paris literary circles.  What is The Interrogation? Most likely a myth without distinct delineations. A very solitary young man, Adam Pollo, perhaps the first man, perhaps the last, has a very remarkable interior adventure. He concentrates and he discovers ways of being, ways of seeing. He enters into animals, into a tree.... He has no business, no distractions; he is at the complete disposal of life. All of life, that is, except the society of his own species -- and so the story ends.  \"This is the next phase after the 'the new novel,'\" wrote the critics. Kafka they said; a direct descendant of Joyce, they said. Beckett they said. Like nothing else, they said. One hundred thousand Frenchmen bought it. They said it was strange and beautiful. Finally the real voice of the young, said the critics. \"I like J. D. Salinger,\" said Mr. Le Cl\u00e9zio, and that was all he said.

He constituted a kind of foreign body that the hotel's atmosphere could not assimilate. Not that he looked like a cartoon policeman. He didn't have a moustache and he didn't wear heavy boots. His clothes were well cut and made of fairly light worsted. He shaved every day and looked after his hands. But his frame was proletarian. He was a big, bony man. His firm muscles filled out his jacket and quickly pulled all his trousers out of shape. He had a way of imposing himself just by standing there. His assertive presence had often irked many of his own colleagues.In Simenon's first novel featuring Maigret, the laconic detective is taken from grimy bars to luxury hotels as he traces the true identity of Pietr the Latvian. Georges Simenon was born in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, in 1903. Best known in Britain as the author of the Maigret books, his prolific output of over 400 novels and short stories have made him a household name in continental Europe. He died in 1989 in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he had lived for the latter part of his life.David Bellos is Director of the Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication at Princeton University and has won many awards for his translations including the Man Booker International Translator's Award (2005).", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439417072i/140734.jpg", "genres": ["Crime", "Detective", "France", "Thriller", "Noir", "Novels", "Classics", "Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Fiction"], "asin": "0140020233", "isbn": "0140020233", "isbn13": "9780140020236", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "series": ["Inspector Maigret"], "author": ["Daphne Woodward", "Georges Simenon"], "publishDate": -181670400000, "characters": ["Mrs. Mortimer-Levingston", "Monsieur Leon", "Olaf Swaan", "Jules Maigret", "Fedor Yurovich", "Mr. Mortimer-Levingston", "Pietr the Latvian", "Oswald Oppenheim", "Joseph Torrence", "Berthe Swaan", "The Superintendent of Criminal Investigation", "Anna Gorskin", "Judge Ernest Com\u00e9liau", "Pepito Moretto", "Andr\u00e9 Lucas", "Inspector Dufour", "Detective Bornier", "Louise Maigret", "The manager of the Hotel Majestic", "Major Howard"], "places": ["Normandy", "Paris", "Le Havre"], "ratingHistogram": [172, 789, 3364, 2877, 1072], "ratingsCount": 8274, "reviewsCount": 1011, "numPages": 144, "language": "English"}

Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les semaines passent, on en apprend un peu plus \u00e0 son sujet. Il s'appelle Gaston et se pr\u00e9tend gar\u00e7on de bureau. Tr\u00e8s vite, sa tenue vestimentaire se rel\u00e2che. Gaston envoie balader son noeud-pap', arbore un pull-over de couleur verte, des blue-jeans et une paire d'espadrilles du plus bel effet.

From the confessions of a racing cyclist to the plans of an avenging murderer, from a young ethnographer obsessed with a Sumatran tribe to the death of a trapeze artist, from the fears of an ex-croupier to the dreams of a sex-change pop star to an eccentric English millionaire who has devised the ultimate pastime, Life is a manual of human irony, portraying the mixed marriages of fortunes, passions and despairs, betrayals and bereavements, of hundreds of lives in Paris and around the world.But the novel is more than an extraordinary range of fictions; it is a closely observed account of life and experience. The apartment block's one hundred rooms are arranged in a magic square, and the book as a whole is peppered with a staggering range of literary puzzles and allusions, acrostics, problems of chess and logic, crosswords, and mathematical formulae.

For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses", "title": "Ulysses", "titleComplete": "Ulysses", "description": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.\" According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\". Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted textual \"Joyce Wars.\" The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose\u2014replete with puns, parodies, and allusions\u2014as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.'", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345i/338798.jpg", "genres": ["Novels", "Literature", "Ireland", "Banned Books", "Classics", "Literary Fiction", "20th Century", "Irish Literature", "Fiction", "Unfinished"], "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["James Joyce", "John M.

The novel's vision of Soviet life in the 1930s is so ferociously accurate that it could not be published during its author's lifetime and appeared only in a censored edition in the 1960s. Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan.

A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. Although it follows the movement of thousands of men and women and the transformation of an entire nation, The Grapes of Wrath is also the story of one Oklahoma family, the Joads, who are driven off their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. First published in 1939, The Grapes of Wrath summed up its era in the way that Uncle Tom's Cabin summed up the years of slavery before the Civil War. Sensitive to fascist and communist criticism, Steinbeck insisted that \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" be printed in its entirety in the first edition of the book\u2014which takes its title from the first verse: \"He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\" At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s fictional chronicle of the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s is perhaps the most American of American Classics.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302892i/4395.jpg", "genres": ["Classic Literature", "Historical", "School", "American", "Novels", "Literature", "Classics", "Historical Fiction", "High School", "Fiction"], "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["John Steinbeck"], "publishDate": 1010476800000, "characters": ["Jim Casy", "Granma Joad", "Ruthie Joad", "Noah Joad", "Connie Rivers", "Uncle John Joad", "Tom Joad", "Al Joad", "Ma Joad", "Rose of Sharon Joad Rivers", "Pa Joad", "Grampa Joad", "Winfield Joad"], "places": ["California", "Oklahoma", "The United States of America", "Route 66"], "ratingHistogram": [34438, 58359, 154210, 275446, 379512], "ratingsCount": 901965, "reviewsCount": 23758, "numPages": 455, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -946742400000, "category": "Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award", "awardedAt": -978278400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "California Book Award", "awardedAt": -978278400000, "category": "General Literature (Silver)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": "Classic", "hasWon": null}]}
