But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566425108i/33.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "High Fantasy", "Novels", "Young Adult", "Classics", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy", "Literature"], "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "series": ["The Lord of the Rings"], "author": ["J.R.R.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Medieval", "Historical", "British Literature", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Novels", "Adult", "Classics", "Audiobook"], "publisher": "NAL Trade", "series": ["Kingsbridge"], "author": ["Ken Follett"], "publishDate": 1012809600000, "characters": ["Jack Jackson", "Stephen of England", "Henry II of England", "Empress Matilda", "William Hamleigh", "Richard of Kingsbridge", "Ellen", "Tom Builder", "Alfred Builder", "Waleran Bigod", "Lady Regan Hamleigh", "Remigius", "Lord Percy Hamleigh", "Aliena", "Prior Philip", "Thomas Becket"], "places": ["England"], "ratingHistogram": [13208, 23373, 80603, 219283, 423551], "ratingsCount": 760018, "reviewsCount": 37307, "numPages": 976, "language": "English"}
{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "title": "Persuasion", "titleComplete": "Persuasion", "description": "Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413i/2156.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Fiction", "Historical Romance", "Classics", "Romance", "Audiobook", "Literature", "19th Century", "Classic Literature"], "asin": "0192802631", "isbn": "0192802631", "isbn13": "9780192802637", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "author": ["Deidre Shauna Lynch", "Richard Fadem", "Jane Austen", "James Kinsley", "\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043d \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d"], "publishDate": 1072944000000, "characters": ["Mary Musgrove", "Captain James Benwick", "William Elliot", "Sophia Croft", "Louisa Musgrove", "Charles Musgrove", "Mrs. Smith", "Henrietta Musgrove", "Lady Russell", "Elizabeth Elliot", "Captain Frederick Wentworth", "Sir Walter Elliot", "Penelope Clay", "Captain Harville", "Anne Elliot", "Admiral Croft"], "places": ["Lyme Regis, England", "England", "United Kingdom", "Bath, Somerset, England", "Somerset, England"], "ratingHistogram": [11473, 25883, 118109, 232424, 309491], "ratingsCount": 697380, "reviewsCount": 32436, "numPages": 249, "language": "English"}

A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses", "title": "Ulysses", "titleComplete": "Ulysses", "description": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.\" According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\". Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted textual \"Joyce Wars.\" The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose\u2014replete with puns, parodies, and allusions\u2014as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.'", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345i/338798.jpg", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Fiction", "20th Century", "Novels", "Classics", "Ireland", "Irish Literature", "Banned Books", "Unfinished", "Literature"], "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["James Joyce", "John M.

It begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867i/3412.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Drama", "Fiction", "Historical Romance", "Novels", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Classics", "Romance"], "publisher": "Avon Books", "author": ["Colleen McCullough"], "publishDate": 1009872000000, "characters": ["Dane O'Neill", "Justine O'Neill", "Harold \"Hal\" Cleary", "Padraic \"Paddy\" Cleary", "Stuart \"Stu\" Cleary", "Mary Elizabeth Cleary Carson", "James and Patrick \"Jims and Patsy\" Cleary", "Bob Cleary", "Francis \"Frank\" Cleary", "Archbishop (later Cardinal) Vittorio di Contini-Verchese", "Luddie Mueller", "Rainer \"Rain\" Moerling Hartheim", "Meghann \"Meggie\" Cleary", "Ralph de Bricassart", "Hughie Cleary", "Fiona \"Fee\" Cleary", "Anne Mueller", "Jack Cleary", "Luke O'Neill"], "places": ["Australia", "Vatican City", "Outback", "New Zealand"], "ratingHistogram": [4032, 11501, 51713, 109843, 171927], "ratingsCount": 349016, "reviewsCount": 7870, "numPages": 692, "language": "English"}

War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.As Napoleon\u2019s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds\u2014peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers\u2014as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving\u2014and human\u2014figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413215930i/656.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Russia", "Historical", "Fiction", "Russian Literature", "War", "Novels", "Classics", "Literature", "19th Century"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "author": ["Aylmer Maude", "Leo Tolstoy", "Louise Maude"], "publishDate": 898758000000, "characters": ["Anna Drubetskaya", "Adolf Berg", "Vasili Denisov", "Prince Andrey Bokonsky", "Boris Drubetskoy", "Mademoiselle Bourienne", "Ilya Rostov", "Lise Bolkonskaya", "Helene Kuragina", "Osip Basdeev", "Pierre Bezukhov", "Anna Scherer", "Nikolai Bolkonsky", "Petya Rostov", "Vera Rostova", "Maria Bolkonskaya", "Fedja Dolochov", "Anatole Kuragin", "Nikolai Rostov", "Platon Karataev", "Sonya Rostova", "Natasha Rostova", "Mikhail Kutuzov"], "places": ["Moscow", "Russia", "St. Petersburg"], "ratingHistogram": [8182, 14734, 49245, 99005, 154939], "ratingsCount": 326105, "reviewsCount": 17128, "numPages": 1392, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1672560000000, "category": "Literary Fiction & Classics and Nominee for Best Female Narrator", "hasWon": null}]}

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn\u2019t so bad\u2014at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d with his own \u201cHeil Puccini\u201d, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de Berni\u00e8res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Se\u00f1or Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island\u2014the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins\u2014would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Berni\u00e8res seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479680795i/3388.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Fiction", "Greece", "War", "Novels", "Classics", "Romance", "World War II", "Literature"], "asin": "067976397X", "isbn": "067976397X", "isbn13": "9780679763970", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["Louis de Berni\u00e8res"], "publishDate": 809679600000, "characters": ["Antonio Corelli", "Dr Iannis", "Mandras", "Pelagia"], "places": ["Kefalonia", "Greece"], "ratingHistogram": [2065, 4679, 15986, 30993, 32817], "ratingsCount": 86540, "reviewsCount": 3431, "numPages": 437, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Commonwealth Writers' Prize", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "Best Book Overall", "hasWon": null}]}

In recent years it has been named to \u201cbest novels\u201d lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy\u2014it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he\u2019s assigned, he\u2019ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller\u2019s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller\u2019s personal archive; and much more.
