Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood--where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned--Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor--engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.Like the protagonist of Gulliver's Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey--hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362i/30555488.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Race", "Historical", "African American", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Novels"], "asin": "0385542364", "isbn": "0385542364", "isbn13": "9780385542364", "publisher": "Doubleday", "author": ["Colson Whitehead"], "publishDate": 1470121200000, "characters": ["Caesar (The Underground Railroad)", "Boseman (The Underground Railroad)", "Ethel Wells", "Homer (The Underground Railroad)", "Arnold Ridgeway", "Mabel Randall", "Cora Randall", "Ajarry (The Underground Railroad)", "Martin Wells", "Lovey (The Underground Railroad)", "Molly (The Underground Railroad)", "Sybil (The Underground Railroad)", "Royal (The Underground Railroad)"], "places": ["North Carolina", "Tennessee", "South Carolina", "Indiana", "Georgia", "The United States of America"], "ratingHistogram": [6134, 16618, 70684, 163864, 145035], "ratingsCount": 402335, "reviewsCount": 31907, "numPages": 320, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award", "awardedAt": 1451635200000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Best SF Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Arthur C.

Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other\u2019s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Kenya.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist\u2019s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city\u2019s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life\u2014divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house\u2014and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco\u2019s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang\u2014who thrived and who faltered\u2014and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie\u2019s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou\u2019s far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both\u2014and escape the merciless progress of time\u2014in the transporting realms of art and music.

The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. Today The Magnificent Ambersons is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, \"It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right.\" \"The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,\" judged Van Wyck Brooks. \"[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Amber-sons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end.\"Booth Tarkington (1869-1946), a prolific writer who achieved overnight success with his first novel, The Gentleman from Indiana (1899), is perhaps best remembered as the author of the popular Penrod adventures and Seventeen (1916). He was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize for the novel Alice Adams (1921).", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171925907i/127028.jpg", "genres": ["20th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Classics", "The United States Of America", "American", "Classic Literature", "Fiction", "Literature", "Novels"], "asin": "1406935735", "isbn": "1406935735", "isbn13": "9781406935738", "publisher": "Hard Press", "series": ["The Growth Trilogy"], "author": ["Booth Tarkington"], "publishDate": 1162540800000, "characters": ["George Amberson Minafer", "Isabel Amberson Minafer", "Lucy Morgan", "Eugene Morgan"], "places": ["Indianapolis, Indiana", "Indiana"], "ratingHistogram": [260, 831, 3019, 4451, 2989], "ratingsCount": 11550, "reviewsCount": 1091, "numPages": 288, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -1609430400000, "category": "Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

Left an orphan at 19 years old in the late 1880s, Selina Peake needs to support herself. She leaves the city life she has known to become a teacher in the farming community of High Prairie, IL. Her father had told her that life is an adventure, and one should make the most of it.Selina sees beauty everywhere, including in the fields of cabbages. She has a natural curiosity about farming and oversteps the woman's traditional role by having the audacity to ask the men questions. She soon marries Pervus DeJong, a farmer. Selina eagerly offers suggestions for operational improvements, but Pervus ignores her, preferring to use the unprofitable farming methods employed by his father.Though she suffers many hardships, Selina always remembers the importance of beauty, and she admires those who exercise their creative talents. She tries to instill these views in her son Dirk and fights with her husband over the need for their child to get a full education. Once Dirk finishes college and starts work, will he retain Selina's values?So Big was the first book to have the rare distinction of being the best-selling book of the year and win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348572158i/149149.jpg", "genres": ["20th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Classics", "American", "Historical", "Book Club", "Fiction", "Literature", "Novels"], "asin": "0060956690", "isbn": "0060956690", "isbn13": "9780060956691", "publisher": "Harper Perennial Modern Classics", "author": ["Edna Ferber"], "publishDate": 966927600000, "places": ["Chicago, Illinois"], "ratingHistogram": [113, 411, 2073, 4341, 3993], "ratingsCount": 10931, "reviewsCount": 1220, "numPages": 252, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -1420041600000, "category": "Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

Born in 1905, Daisy Stone Goodwill drifts through the roles of child, wife, widow, and mother, and finally into her old age. Bewildered by her inability to understand her place in her own life, Daisy attempts to find a way to tell her story within a novel that is itself about the limitations of autobiography. Her life is vivid with incident, and yet she feels a sense of powerlessness. She listens, she observes, and through sheer force of imagination she becomes a witness of her own life: her birth, her death, and the troubling missed connections she discovers between. Daisy's struggle to find a place for herself in her own life is a paradigm of the unsettled decades of our era. A witty and compassionate anatomist of the human heart, Carol Shields has made distinctively her own that place where the domestic collides with the elemental. With irony and humor she weaves the strands of The Stone Diaries together in this, her richest and most poignant novel to date.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1285159303i/77554.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Contemporary", "Womens", "Literary Fiction", "Canada", "Classics", "Canadian Literature", "Fiction", "Literature", "Novels"], "asin": "014023313X", "isbn": "014023313X", "isbn13": "9780140233131", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["Carol Shields"], "publishDate": 796723200000, "places": ["Ottawa, Ontario", "Bloomington, Indiana", "Canada", "Florida", "Indiana", "Manitoba"], "ratingHistogram": [720, 2440, 9578, 15646, 12010], "ratingsCount": 40394, "reviewsCount": 2225, "numPages": 361, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 725875200000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Governor General's Literary Awards / Prix litt\u00e9raires du Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral", "awardedAt": 725875200000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award", "awardedAt": 725875200000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah.

Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clear-sighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But given the time and the place, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy his future, and so Elwood arrives at The Nickel Academy, which claims to provide 'physical, intellectual and moral training' which will equip its inmates to become 'honorable and honest men'.In reality, the Nickel Academy is a chamber of horrors, where physical, emotional and sexual abuse is rife, where corrupt officials and tradesmen do a brisk trade in supplies intended for the school, and where any boy who resists is likely to disappear 'out back'. Stunned to find himself in this vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr King's ringing assertion, 'Throw us in jail, and we will still love you.' But Elwood's fellow inmate and new friend Turner thinks Elwood is naive and worse; the world is crooked, and the only way to survive is to emulate the cruelty and cynicism of their oppressors.The tension between Elwood's idealism and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision which will have decades-long repercussions.Based on the history of a real reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped and destroyed the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative by a great American novelist whose work is essential to understanding the current reality of the United States.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593115396i/42270835.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Race", "Historical", "African American", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Novels"], "publisher": "Doubleday", "author": ["Colson Whitehead"], "publishDate": 1563260400000, "characters": ["Elwood Curtis", "Griff (The Nickel Boys)", "Desmond (The Nickel Boys)", "Harriet Johnson", "Jaimie (The Nickel Boys)", "Jack Turner (The Nickel Boys)", "Maynard Spencer"], "places": ["Tallahassee, Florida", "The United States of America", "Florida"], "ratingHistogram": [1823, 5452, 30878, 96505, 111563], "ratingsCount": 246221, "reviewsCount": 23827, "numPages": 213, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Orwell Prize", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "Political Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "Best Male Narrator", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "ALA Alex Award", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Dayton Literary Peace Prize", "awardedAt": 1577865600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lincoln Award", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Kirkus Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Historical Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Dublin Literary Award", "awardedAt": 1609488000000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Barnes & Noble Book of the Year Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600241424i/6288.jpg", "genres": ["Post Apocalyptic", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Dystopia", "Fiction", "Horror", "Apocalyptic", "Literature", "Science Fiction", "Novels"], "asin": "0307265439", "isbn": "0307265439", "isbn13": "9780307265432", "publisher": "Alfred A.

A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. Although it follows the movement of thousands of men and women and the transformation of an entire nation, The Grapes of Wrath is also the story of one Oklahoma family, the Joads, who are driven off their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. First published in 1939, The Grapes of Wrath summed up its era in the way that Uncle Tom's Cabin summed up the years of slavery before the Civil War. Sensitive to fascist and communist criticism, Steinbeck insisted that \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" be printed in its entirety in the first edition of the book\u2014which takes its title from the first verse: \"He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\" At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s fictional chronicle of the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s is perhaps the most American of American Classics.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302892i/4395.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "High School", "Classics", "School", "American", "Historical", "Classic Literature", "Fiction", "Literature", "Novels"], "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["John Steinbeck"], "publishDate": 1010476800000, "characters": ["Rose of Sharon Joad Rivers", "Al Joad", "Grampa Joad", "Winfield Joad", "Ruthie Joad", "Connie Rivers", "Granma Joad", "Uncle John Joad", "Noah Joad", "Jim Casy", "Pa Joad", "Tom Joad", "Ma Joad"], "places": ["Oklahoma", "Route 66", "California", "The United States of America"], "ratingHistogram": [34576, 58694, 155092, 277494, 382859], "ratingsCount": 908715, "reviewsCount": 24128, "numPages": 455, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": -946742400000, "category": "Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award", "awardedAt": -978278400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "California Book Award", "awardedAt": -978278400000, "category": "General Literature (Silver)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": "Classic", "hasWon": null}]}
