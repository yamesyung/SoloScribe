A deputy sheriff, Lou's known to the small-time criminals, the real-estate entrepreneurs, and all of his coworkers--the low-lifes, the big-timers, and everyone in-between--as the nicest guy around. He may not be the brightest or the most interesting man in town, but nevertheless, he's the kind of officer you're happy to have keeping your streets safe. The sort of man you might even wish your daughter would end up with someday.But behind the platitudes and glad-handing lurks a monster the likes of which few have seen. An urge that has already claimed multiple lives, and cost Lou his brother Mike, a self-sacrificing construction worker who fell to his death on the job in what was anything but an accident. A murder that Lou is determined to avenge--and if innocent people have to die in the process, well, that's perfectly all right with him.In The Killer Inside Me, Thompson goes where few novelists have dared to go, giving us a pitch-black glimpse into the mind of the American Serial Killer years before Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and Brett Easton Ellis's American Psycho, in the novel that will forever be known as the master performance of one of the greatest crime novelists of all time.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403187402i/298663.jpg", "genres": ["Novels", "Suspense", "Noir", "Fiction", "Horror", "Classics", "Mystery Thriller", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Crime"], "asin": "0679733973", "isbn": "0679733973", "isbn13": "9780679733973", "publisher": "Vintage Crime/Black Lizard", "author": ["Jim Thompson"], "publishDate": 668851200000, "characters": ["Lou Ford", "Joyce Lakeland"], "places": ["Texas", "Corpus Christi, Texas"], "ratingHistogram": [564, 1544, 5295, 8967, 6771], "ratingsCount": 23141, "reviewsCount": 1727, "numPages": 244, "language": "English"}

When Barnum said, \"There's one born every minute, and two to take him,\" he didn't know about Fred Fitch; when Fred Fitch was born, there were two million to take him.\tEvery itinerant grifter, hypester, bunk artist, short-conner, amuser, shearer, short-changer, green-goods worker, pennyweighter, ring dropper, and yentzer to hit New York City considers his trip incomplete until he's also hit Fred Fitch. He's sort of the con-man's version of Go: Pass Fred Fitch, collect two hundred dollars, and move on.\tWhat happens to Fred Fitch when his long-lost Uncle Matt dies and leaves Fred three hundred thousand dollars shouldn't happen to the ball in a pinball machine. Fred Fitch with three hundred thousand dollars is like a mouse with a sack of catnip: He's likely to attract the wrong kind of attention.\tAdd to this the fact that Uncle Matt was murdered, by person or persons unknown, and that someone now seems determined to murder Fred as well, mix in two daffily charming beauties of totally different types, and you have a perfect setup for the busiest fictional hero since the well-known one-armed paperhanger. As Fred Fitch careers across the New York City landscape-and sometimes skyline-in his meetings with cops, con men, beautiful girls, and (maybe) murderers, he takes on some of the loonier aspects of a Dante without a Virgil. Take one part comedy and one part suspense and shake well-mostly with laughter.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388438174i/228004.jpg", "genres": ["Novels", "Suspense", "20th Century", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Mystery", "Humor", "Thriller", "Comedy", "Crime"], "asin": "076530919X", "isbn": "076530919X", "isbn13": "9780765309198", "publisher": "Forge Books", "author": ["Donald E.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal\u2014and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:\"Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\"When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638425885i/16299.jpg", "genres": ["Audiobook", "Suspense", "Murder Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Classics", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Crime", "Adult"], "asin": "0312330871", "isbn": "0312330871", "isbn13": "9780312330873", "publisher": "St. Martin's Griffin", "author": ["Agatha Christie"], "publishDate": 1083567600000, "characters": ["Dr Edward George Armstrong", "Mrs Ethel Rogers", "Justice Lawrence John Wargrave", "Anthony James Marston", "Mr Thomas Rogers", "Fred Narracott", "General John Gordon Macarthur", "Philip Lombard", "William Henry Blore", "Isaac Morris", "Vera Elizabeth Claythorne", "Emily Caroline Brent"], "places": ["England", "Devon, England"], "ratingHistogram": [19447, 34371, 171852, 443899, 672076], "ratingsCount": 1341645, "reviewsCount": 63567, "numPages": 264, "language": "English"}
